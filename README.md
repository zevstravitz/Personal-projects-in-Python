## Hexapawn
Program that constructs game tree and uses naive search algorithm to prune solutions that lead to losses. Eventually I'd hope to implement a more robust algorithm like the minimax algorithm or alpha-beta pruning.

## Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
Graph-based program that is capable of finding degrees between two actors based on the IMDB database for movies and actors. Also finds actor with most edges and least edges.

## Computer Algebra and Calculus System
### Programs can:
* Graphs functions and its derivative
* Graphs line of best fit based off of bivariate dataset
* Graphs points in 3-D cartesian space
* Evaluate Definite Integrals

## Conways Game of Life
Cellular automota (zero-player game) that simulates expansion of cells based off of rules.
See description of game here: [Conways Game of Life] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Hangman
Text-based hangman game based off of imported dictionary.


#Note
All programs are written in Python 2.7
